2 NOTE Tests a situation where we connect cycle, but we don't add any individuals at the same time. This resulted in a null pointers in summarised data, which was spotted by the layout calculation telling that leftmost_parent of a node is null. Open in marked order and check that the order pointers get updated after opening "Gen3 Bar".
3 CONC Another issue would be having "Second" and "Gen3 Bar" on different sides of "First"'s family, if "First" is on the right of "Second". This doesn't break the current constraints, but looks bad. So, not really a bug, but should be improved.
